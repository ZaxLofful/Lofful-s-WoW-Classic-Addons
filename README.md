# Lofful's WoW Classic Addons
 This is an autoupdated list of the addons I use in game. Lots of good stuff...

List of Addons and Mini-Tutorial for Each:

Auctioner - Basically An Auto-Auction Addon

When you open the auction house it adds extra tabs that are very usefull and will auto-calc prices and stacks for you. Super easy to make money this way.

ZPERL - UI Addon that makes everything moveable and themeable. I use this to arange my addons party portraits (including my own) into a better view.

I personally like to have my chracter portrait right next to my character in the middle of the screen. That way I can see my health and my enemies health as a side by side comparison without looking away.

Usage:

/zperl in the chat window: This allows you to move everything around and will bring up an extra customziation window to change things even more.

When using the new Auctioner, just allow it to do a full auto-scan

Release Notes:

I took out Guide Ally Routes, because it was messing up during QA Unit testing.
